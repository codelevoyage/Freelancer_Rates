### What I Learned

- **Order of Operations** – JavaScript follows standard math rules (PEMDAS) when evaluating expressions.
- **Shorthand Assignment Operators** – Such as `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, and `/=`, which provide a more concise way to update variable values.
- **Rounding** – Learned how to round numbers using functions like `Math.floor()`, `Math.ceil()`, and `Math.round()`.
